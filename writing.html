	<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Big-Muddy-Environmental-Mississippi/dp/0195316916" target="_blank">The Big Muddy: An Environmental History of the Mississippi and Its Peoples from Hernando de Soto to Hurricane Katrina</a></h3>
	<p class="description">The first long-term environmental history of the Mississippi, this book spans five centuries to discuss the interaction between people and the landscape, from early hunter-gatherer bands to present-day industrial and post-industrial society. Hernando de Soto found an incredibly vast wetland. But since then, much has changed. By the 1890s, the valley was rapidly drying as a consequence of intensified human meddling--including deforestation, swamp drainage, monocropping, and most monumentally, the reconstruction of the river itself, largely under the direction of the Army Corps of Engineers—which repressed the valley’s essential wet nature. However, a repressed wet nature had a habit of returning, often in unrecognized forms, including drought, disease, and spontaneously combusting swamplands, but always, of course, by flooding. Valley residents have been paying the price for these human interventions, for the repression of the valley’s nature. And nature keeps returning with ever more damaging symptoms of its pathological condition, most visibly with the disaster that followed Hurricane Katrina. </p>

	<h4>Reviews</h4>
	<p> "What is remarkable and fresh about this scholarly study of the Mississippi in the longue duree is its comprehensiveness, density, and nuance, as well as the fresh research upon which it is based. It is a sturdy, grand, and at times stunning achievement, deeply rooted in substantial interdisciplinary research and brimming with insight."--<em>American Historical Review</em></p>

	<p>“Seven years ago this month, Hurricane Katrina triggered massive flooding in the valley of the Mississippi. The environmental backstory of the catastrophe is as rich as river sediment, and historian Christopher Morris takes us through 500 years of it. The valley's metamorphosis from vast wetland staked out by France and Spain to a patchwork of development — drained swamp,levees, deforestation, industry and poor urban planning — is powerfully recounted.” --<em>Nature</em></p>

	<p>"Elegantly written, <em>The Big Muddy</em> is a sweeping environmental history of a famous river told with an eye toward the relationship between water and land." --<em>Journal of American History</em></p>

	<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Southern-Evolution-Vicksburg-Mississippi/dp/0195134214" target="_blank">Becoming Southern: The Evolution of a Way of Life, Warren County and Vicksburg, Mississippi, 1770-1860</a></h3>
	<p class="description">This study challenges the old notion of an economic and culturally static South that stood in contrast to a dynamic North and argues that the South became different from the North. At the end of the 18 th century Mississippi was socially, economically, and culturally more western than southern, having more in common with Illinois than with South Carolina. However, when men increasingly and often violently seized control over extended kin networks to acquire land and slaves, an emerging patriarchy redefined relations between masters and slaves, husbands and wives, planters and yeoman farmers, and this western place became the southern place that its white residents defended in the Civil War. </p>

	<h4>Reviews</h4>
	<p>"Christopher Morris displays the enviable ability to combine analytical sophistication and detailed analysis of local sources with a strong narrative and appropriate generalisations...[A] valuable source for students of all aspects of antebellum southern life." -- <em>American Studies Today</em></p>

	<p>"Morris's research is prodigious, his presentation captivating." --<em>New Orleans Review</em></p>

	<p>"This thoughtful, well-written study doubtless will be widely read and deservedly influential."-- <em>American Historical Review</em></p>

Laura Kilcer VanHuss (Baton Rouge: LSU Press, 2021), 191-222.</h3>
	<p>Charting the Plantation Landscape from Natchez to New Orleans examines the hidden histories behind one of the nineteenth-century South’s most famous maps: Norman’s Chart of the Lower Mississippi River, created by surveyor Marie Adrien Persac before the Civil War and used for decades to guide the pilots of river vessels. In this collection, contributors from a variety of disciplines consider the histories that Persac’s map omitted, exploring plantations not as sites of ease and plenty, but as complex legal, political, and medical landscapes. Christopher Morris uses the famed Uncle Sam Plantation to explain how plantations have been memorialized, remembered, and preserved.</p>

	<p>Building on our earlier computational analysis of 237 digitized maps of the Great Lakes, we use maps and accounts of Lake Huron, bookended by those of Samuel de Champlain (1616) and Henry Bayfield (1828), to explore the concept of “somageography”: how first-hand experiences with natural environments are filtered and reconfigured by map-makers, rendering maps as irreducibly complex representations of particular human and environmental conditions. </p>

	<p>The study of historical maps as a group or body poses interpretive challenges on a number of fronts: maps are representations of geophysical spaces, and yet they are also works of art, produced, exchanged, and viewed within the commercial and sociopolitical contexts of the cartographers’ time and culture.</p>
