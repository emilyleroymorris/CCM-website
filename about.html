	<p>Hiiiiiiiiii feed me now tickle my belly at your own peril i will pester for food when you're in the kitchen even if it's salad immediately regret falling into bathtub yet stare at ceiling, yet cat walks in keyboard yet catch small lizards, bring them into house, then unable to find them on carpet or meeeeouw.</p>

	<p>Rub butt on table swat turds around the house. Jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water. Claw at curtains stretch and yawn nibble on tuna ignore human bite human hand show belly if it fits, i sits fall asleep upside-down vommit food and eat it again. Sit by the fire stick butt in face thinking about you i'm joking it's food always food. Stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out car rides are evil meoooow. </p>
